# Economic-Dispatch-with-three-power-plants

Implementation on Matlab

This is script for economic dispatching of three power plants only.

How it works?
It takes input (quadratic equations) of three different power plants and asks for fuel cost/hr for each power plant. The constraint for total power is also asked from user. Using the langrange multiplier, optimal power for all three power plants is calculated.
